								<h2>Purpose</h2>
								<p>The purpose of the dashboard is to provide Redwood Reality Executive’s and Sale’s Managers key metrics on their performance and insights. The dashboard was created to display the total value of properties, average value of properties, and count of properties by listing status. The dashboard also illustrates the count of properties by bedroom, average property lot size by decade built, and a map of listings by zip code and listing status. </p>
	
									<h2>Data Overview</h2>
									<p>The files are named "Murphy_PartOne_Data1" and "Murphy_PartOne_Data1" the data comes from the CDC COVID Tracker website available online. The dataset contains 50 rows of data one for each state in the U.S. and the state name is the unique identifer that links the datasets together. The data source contains 5 quantitative predictors (Population, Total Cases, Cases Past 7 Days, Deaths Past 7 Days, and Total Area in Sq. Mi.) and 3 qualitative predictors (Region*, Coastal, and Govnor Party Affiliation. The "Create Data Summary Statistics" will output a dashboard with meaningful summaries that includes all the numeric data.

										*Region Northeast Region = 1, Midwest Region = 2, South Region = 3, West Region = 4
										which is actually the average rating of the product based on all reviews. </p>
									<h2>Research Questions</h2>
									<p>1) Do states with Republican govnors have more Total Deaths by state compared to states with Democratic govnors?

										<p>2) Do states from the South Region have more Total Cases by state compared to states from the Midwest Region?
										
											<p>3) Do states from the South Region have more Total Deaths by state compared to states from the Midwest Region? </p>
											
									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>After performing the first regression on the research question "Do states with Republican govnors have more Total Deaths by state compared to states with Democratic govnors?" we can see that the regression yeilds a p-value of 0.53 which is greater than alpha. Conclusion: Fail to Reject Ho: We can't reject that the means are the same. This means that we cannot say states with Republican govnors have a higher mean of Total Deaths as compared to states with Democratic govnors.

										Similarly, for the reseach question "Do states from the South Region have more Total Cases by state compared to states from the Midwest Region?" we can see the the ANOVA test yields a p-value of 0.4192 which is greater than alpha. Conclusion: Fail to Reject Ho: We can't reject that the means are the same. This means that we cannot say states from the South Region have more Total Cases by state compared to states from the Midwest Region.
										
										Lastly, for the reseach question "Do states from the South Region have more Total Deaths by state compared to states from the Midwest Region?" we can see the the ANOVA test yields a p-value of 0.49 which is greater than alpha. Conclusion: Fail to Reject Ho: We can't reject that the means are the same. This means that we cannot say states from the South Region have more Total Deaths by state compared to states from the Midwest Region. </p>
